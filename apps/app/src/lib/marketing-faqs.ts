  {
    q: 'Can I use cms Cloud now?',
    a: 'Yes. cms Cloud is live and free while in beta — managed docs hosting, sign-in, publishing, search, and custom domains.',
  },
  {
    q: 'Is cms open source?',
    a: 'Yes. The source repository is public under AGPL-3.0, and the self-hosted release includes a pinned GHCR image and guided Docker Compose installer.',
  },
  {
    q: 'What happens after the beta?',
    a: 'Paid cloud plans will come later, announced with generous advance notice, and beta workspaces will get preferential treatment. Self-hosting remains available under AGPL-3.0.',
  },
  {
    q: 'Are there limits during the beta?',
    a: 'The beta runs on a fair-use basis rather than hard plan limits. If a workspace is unusually heavy on resources, we will reach out before anything changes.',
  },
  {
    q: 'Can I use my own object storage?',
    a: 'Absolutely. cms speaks the S3 API, so it works with any S3-compatible storage (AWS S3, Cloudflare R2, Backblaze B2, or the bundled storage service).',
  },
  {
    q: 'How does search work?',
    a: 'The built-in Orama path provides full-text and fuzzy results. Source main also includes an optional tenant-filtered Qdrant hybrid path and opt-in grounded answers; operators start in shadow mode and retain the legacy path for rollback.',
  },
