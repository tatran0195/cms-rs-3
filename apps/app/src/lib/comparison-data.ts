      'You want search and reader analytics built in, without wiring up Algolia or an analytics service.',
      'You want a managed option in free beta with custom domains and do not require immediate self-hosting.',

    'Docusaurus is excellent at what it does. If engineers are happy in Git and want control of a React codebase, it costs nothing and has a mature public distribution.',
    'cms trades some of that code-level control for a platform normal humans can operate: a real editor, one-click publishing, built-in search and analytics, and a hosted option.

      q: 'Is Docusaurus free?',

    {
      q: 'What is the difference between cms and Docusaurus?',
      a: 'Docusaurus is a static site generator: content is MDX in Git, and developers build and deploy the site. cms is a documentation platform with a WYSIWYG editor over Markdown, versioned publishing, built-in search and analytics, a free cloud beta, and a public AGPL-3.0 self-hosted release.',
    },
    {
      q: 'Does Docusaurus support Arabic and RTL?',
      a: 'Yes — the Docusaurus i18n docs state that right-to-left locales such as Arabic and Hebrew are supported. cms additionally makes the authoring experience RTL-aware: per-language page trees and an editor that handles RTL text natively.',

    {
      q: 'Can I self-host cms and Docusaurus?',
